Rendering sprites
-----------------
Consider what to do with quad data structures
	One structure with a union (with an Enum or parameter)
	Keep them separate
	
	What to name them?

How to load textures/sprites?

Move ORIGIN into maths
Move coordinate transforms for rotated quads into maths
Fix rotations about bottom left
Rotations are definitely completely wrong

Currently quads use RGBA colours but only RGB are sent to the GPU
Currently quads only have one colour instead of colours for each vertex

Currently using RGB format for textures so no transparency

Platform stuff
--------------
Changed from fopen_s back to fopen so may have warning on Windows

Tools
-----
Remove renderdoc from /usr/local/bin so it can capture frames (oops)
